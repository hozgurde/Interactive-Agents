# Conversational-Agent-Framework
A Conversational Agent Framework with Multi-modal Personality Expression


# Using BVH animations on model.

Currently these animations are only applicable for Passport conversation.

BVH files are hold in "Assets/Scripts/Speech2Gesture/ZeggsData" folder.

"E1_CX" folders are used for different personality types where X shows which personality it is. (Appearance order in conversation)

Inside these folders there are "E1_CX_LY_A_TTS.bvh" files which are BVH outputs came from ZEGGS Model. 'Y' number here stands for the speech in particular personality. These are odd numbers as even numbered speechs are used for speech of officer. Therefore changing the contents of these files changes that animation of agent for Xth personality, and Yth speech.
